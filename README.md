5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Definition:** Denial of Service attacks aim to make a resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming the system with requests.
   - **Example:** An attacker floods the server hosting the transaction system with numerous bogus requests, causing legitimate requests to be denied.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, use anti-DDoS technologies, and configure network hardware to handle unexpected spikes in traffic.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**
   - **Definition:** Elevation of Privilege occurs when an attacker gains higher-level permissions than originally assigned, often by exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Example:** An attacker exploits a security flaw in the transaction system to gain admin-level privileges.
   - **Mitigation:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege by ensuring that users have only the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their duties. Regularly update and patch systems to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

**Adding Value as Data Scientists:**
Data scientists can significantly contribute to the threat modeling process by:
- **Analyzing historical incident data** to identify patterns or anomalies that could indicate systemic vulnerabilities.
